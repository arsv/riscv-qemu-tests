Non-priviledged RISC-V tests adapted for QEMU linux-user mode.
See https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests for the originals.

Linux mode implies u-level instructions, so rv64i here means
rv64ui in the original repo.

Because of their minimalistic nature, the tests do not output
much. Silent exit(0) means success, exit(N) with N > 0 means
test tagged N failed. Tag is always the first argument for
the test macros.
